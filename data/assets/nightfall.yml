description: >-
  Emily Carter had been working as an EMT for several years before her life took
  a drastic turn. She was good at her job, known for her calm demeanor under
  pressure and her ability to make patients feel safe even in the direst
  situations. She always felt at home in the high-stakes world of emergency
  response, where she could make a real difference.


  Her dedication to helping others came from a difficult childhood where she
  often had to fend for herself. Raised in the rougher parts of town, Emily was
  no stranger to danger, but she never believed in the supernatural. To her, the
  only monsters were the human kindâ€”until one fateful night shift proved
  otherwise.
